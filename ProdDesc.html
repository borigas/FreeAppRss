For each level, you must place a set of differently shaped blocks into a given shape. You drag blocks in and out of the shape in search for the layout that covers the whole shape. You cannot flip the blocks around as you do in Tetris, however. A level is complete when all blocks have been used and there's no more free space in the shape. </p><div class="h4">Make It Fit</div><p>The first few levels are relatively simple and are designed to get you used to the game's concept and controls. Doodle Fit eventually evolves into a maddening game of geometric logic. Once you unlock the higher levels, get ready for hours of brain-frying puzzlers as you try to fit those darn blocks into increasingly complex shapes. </p><div class="h4">Get a Clue</div><p>If you're at your wits' end, you can raise the white flag and get a hint. When you solve two levels, you're allotted one hint. Because of the limited amount of hints, be sure to use a hint only if you're totally stuck. And no, you can't use a crowbar to cram those blocks in. </p><div class="h4">Hours of Puzzling Pleasure</div><p>Challenge yourself with more than 100 levels involving unique shapes. Many of the puzzles actually have more than one solution; there are almost 250 solutions in total. Doodle Fit features doodle-style graphics with two themes: notebook and chalkboard. Keep track of your stats, including levels solved, solutions found, games played, and time spent. Save up to five profiles so you can compare scores with your fellow Doodle Fit engineers. A cheerful 32-bit melody accompanies the puzzles. S</p><div class="break"></div>
